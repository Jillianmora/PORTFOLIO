         <h2> BIOGRAPHY</h2>
         <p1>Im fifteen years old and an incoming Junior next school year at Castro Valley High School. My hobbies include being outdoors and creating music. I play tennis and enjoy running, hiking, and biking. I have played piano for five years and plan on continuing for the rest of my life. I am not just a foodie but also love to take pictures in my free time. I am very into aesthetics and especially love to take time to plate food pretty to the point it goes cold! I also love to and have been writing and reading poetry for as long as I can remember </p1>
