    <p1> Python and Scratch perform a task the user programs it to perform. Both can do the same things. For example we made a sprite draw shapes based on user input. Python is different from Scratch becasue you don't have blocks so sometimes you don't know how to do something. Python is also harder than Scratch because the language can be confusing unlike Scratch which is pretty straight forward, especially since the blocks have names. Python was difficult at first but it gets easeir the more you play around with it. One particular feature I like in Python is it tells you where and what the error is in your code. </p1>

  <h1>DEBRIEF</h1>
  <p2> The most complicated page we made was a simple circuit that lit up one LED light. A jumper wire connects power to the breadboard and another breadboard connects the breadboard to the Ground. It took us awhile to get the light to light up beacuse we did not know that a row of 5 was connected. When we accidently lit the light we burned it out because we did not connect the resistor correctly. It helped working with others because everyone had different ideas of how to get the light to light up so we were able to use other peoples knowledge to get the LED to light.</p2>
  <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
  <p3> Robots are any device that is programmed to carry out a task or tasks. Today we depend a lot on robots and I am excited to see how they can make our lives even more efficient. Although, I am nervous about the fact we may rely on robots too much and forget how to survive on our own. Working in groups went well because it kade it easier to talk out and solve difficult problems. Next time it would be helpful if we had a little more clarification on instruction and time to experiment.</p3>
  <h4>Light Show</h4>
  <img src="20170710_144326.jpg"/>
  <p4>I learned how to wire a circuit!</p4>
  
            <h5>REFLECTION</h5>
            <p5>Veloso and Howard are both woman in tech who build robots for efficiency and helping daily life. Their bots can help the disabled. They focus on how to make robots smarter and think for themselves. Two people in the team did the code and the other two built the circuit. We could have switched off and explained what we did to eachother because I know I still do not know how to write the code and others may not understand that as well or have trouble with the circuit which I can help them on. The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are void setup and loop.</p5>
  
<h6>REFLECTION</h6>
    <p6>I learned that you need to input the slot the wire for the light is in into the code in the computer. I liked making the robot sing songs. They need outputs for words and sensors.</p6>
<h7>REFLECTION</h7>
<img src="Screenshot (1).png"/>
<p7>I learned how to make a robot move and how to use a sensor to make it turn. My group worked together really well because we all had something to contribute.</p7>
 
<h8>REFLECTION</h8>
<p8>A list is something that you can change and manipulate. You can add its values together as well as extend and shorten the list. I worked well with Juhe and Latisha; they explained concepts and how to solve problems.</p8>
<h9>REFLECTION-7/18/17</h9>
<p9>I learned a lot of the internet is Java Script. LaTeX is a markup because it deals with format.</p9>
<h10>REFLECTION-7/19/2017</h10>
<p10>I do not understand what is MVC and how we are using it to make our blog. I also have no idea what I am doing to create the blog because I am not creating any code. I am just copying and pasteing everything. I would like more pracrice with just atom and creating code. I enjoyed making the robot try to navigate its way around. There is not a project from this summer I would like to extend. Iw ould like to learn the basics of hacking and cracking codes.</p10>
  
  <h11>7/24/17</h11> 
  <p11>The only information about me on the interent is what I have agreed to publish. A programmer can be picky with the passwords the user chooses. Goldwasser and Sweeney create software that protect peoples' privacy.</p11>
  
  <h12>7/26/17</h12>
  <p12>Python dictionaries store data. I think data science is very useful because it can show trends which can tell you what you can do to help an investment. I like how there are many different way tp do something. Algorithms do not have just one method. Algorithms help us sort data quickly so data is more organized which can be helpful to the people whi use or work with that data.</p12>
  
  <h13>7/27/17</h13>
  <p13>It was hard to understand the concept of an object which made it hard to use. I am proud of getting the computer to respond to my input. I made it take in user input and print a response based on the user input.</p13>
  
  <h14>7/28/17</h14>
  <p14>I am proud of being able to store multiple usernames. I am excited about creating the chat bot because I would like to use it to help people.</p14>

  <h15>7/31/14</h15>
  <p15>Speak up!!</p15>
  
  <h16>8/1/17</h16>
  <p16>Half the group is building the Chat Bot and the other half is making the website. I am helping build the Chat Bot. I will manage my time wisely to make sure the project meets the dead line completed!</p16>
  <h17>8/2/17</h17>
  <p17>The greatest challeneg so far has been figuring out how to get the Bot to walk to you after someone tells it a story or asks for advice. I need to learn how to use word detection and input that into the Html code.</p17>
  <h18>8/3/17</h18>
  <p18>We are developing the website and the chatbot at the same time. We all  need some sleep.</p18>
