         <p1>A little about me ??? Well... I live in Castro Valley, the first most recognized unincorporated area in the Bay and the "twenty-third most populus census-designated place in the US" with a population of a whopping 61,000 of eithor old people or young, regretful families that have more recently moved in. WOW does it sound like I am completely miserable living in Castro Valley. Well thats partially true. Its not that im miserable living in Castro Valley, its that in miserabele just living. I would be like this anywhere.  </p1>
