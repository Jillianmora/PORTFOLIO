    <p> Python and Scratch perform a task the user programs it to perform. Both can do the same things. For example we made a sprite draw shapes based on user input. Python is different from Scratch becasue you don't have blocks so sometimes you don't know how to do something. Python is also harder than Scratch because the language can be confusing unlike Scratch which is pretty straight forward, especially since the blocks have names. Python was difficult at first but it gets easeir the more you play around with it.
